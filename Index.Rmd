###Starting this academic year, students no longer have swipe access to residential buildings other than their own. This decision was taken by the administration pre-COVID to maximize the safety of hall residents. Some students have reported that this decreases the chances of socializing and building connections with students who live in other dorm buildings, which may be an issue especially for first-year students. Do you support or oppose the decision to take away swipe access?

###Do you support or oppose the following efforts by DCGA? Each year, the unspent portion of the student activities fees that DCGA allocates to campus organizations goes into a reserve fund and accumulates. This pool of money can be used to fund special projects that benefit the entire student body- for example, the fund was used to establish the Nest on the 3rd floor of Slayter in 2014. The reserve fund can be opened up to spend if savings cross over $700,000. Proposals on how to best use the reserve fund can be brought forth by any student or group and must be approved by the DCGA Senate.
